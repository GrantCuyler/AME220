<h2>Experience</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Kyrene Kids Club</li>
  <p>	 When I worked at kyrene kids club I spent alot of time working with kids and their parents. I learned how to work well with kids and keep them under control while also being able to communicate with parents to make sure thier kid was safe at all times. I worked well under the stress of getting kids from my co-workers rooms to parents that where at the front desk while keeping an eye on the kids around me still. Overall, I feel it provided great work experience</p>
